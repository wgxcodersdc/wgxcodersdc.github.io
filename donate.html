    <h2>What We Do</h2>

    <h2>How Your Donation Is Used</h2>
    <p>As a volunteer-run nonprofit, we keep overhead low and direct funds where they matter most:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Organizational costs</strong> &mdash; tax filings, state registrations, and essential expenses that keep our community running smoothly, such as platform subscriptions (e.g., Meetup).</li>
      <li><strong>Food and refreshments at events</strong> &mdash; providing light refreshments drives significantly higher attendance and fosters a welcoming atmosphere.</li>
      <li><strong>Event spaces</strong> &mdash; while many venues are donated by community partners (hosts may deduct usage as an in-kind contribution), some events require rented space.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="prospectus-section">
    <h2>2026 Goals</h2>

      <li>Enable us to consistently have <strong>2 or more events per month</strong>, with a goal of <strong>24 sessions</strong> by end of year!</li>
      <li>Expand partnerships with other DC-area tech communities</li>
    </ul>
